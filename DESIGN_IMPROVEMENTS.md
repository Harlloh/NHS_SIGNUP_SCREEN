Design Recommendations & Improvements

Below are the main issues I noticed in the original design and the changes I made to improve usability, clarity, and overall user experience. I’ve written these from my perspective, based on the decisions I made during the redesign.

1. Header and Logo Alignment

The header section in the original layout wasn’t well aligned and took up too much vertical space when the page first loaded. This could create a poor first impression and reduce user retention, especially for people on smaller screens.
I reworked the alignment and reduced unnecessary space so the header feels more balanced and doesn’t dominate the page.

2. Reducing the “Wall of Text”

While the introductory information is important, it appeared very dense. To make it easier to read, I separated sections into their own containers and used background blocks to create visual breaks. This helps guide the user’s eyes through the information without overwhelming them.

3. Form Section Headings

The form’s section titles (“Eligibility”, “Contact Details”, “About You”) were quite long and looked slightly inconsistent with the overall layout. I simplified and aligned them left so they feel cleaner and more in line with standard form UX patterns.

4. Eligibility Checkbox Improvements

The eligibility checkboxes originally used long text for each one. I combined the checkbox with a single, clear label so users can understand the requirement quickly.
I wasn’t completely sure about shortening the second eligibility requirement, but I kept the most essential information while maintaining clarity.

5. Added Background Blocks for Hierarchy

Some sections felt visually flat. Adding light background panels helped introduce hierarchy and guide users naturally from one part of the form to the next. This also improves scanning for users with low digital confidence.

6. Improved Required Field Indicators

The asterisk for required fields was quite subtle. I changed it to a clear red indicator so it stands out more, especially for users with limited technical literacy.

7. Consistent Form Styling

Form inputs originally had mixed spacing and styles. I grouped all form fields under a consistent structure, ensuring uniform padding, alignment, and spacing. This creates a cleaner and more predictable flow.

8. Better Focus and Hover States

To improve accessibility, I added clearer focus outlines and hover styles so users can visually see which field they’re interacting with. This is especially helpful for keyboard users or users on older devices.

9. Collapsible Important Notes & Education Definitions

I turned the longer informational text (like “Important Notes” and “Educational Definitions”) into collapsible sections to reduce scrolling.
However, because some users may not be tech-savvy, I kept the accordions open by default, allowing users to collapse them after reading if they want.

10. Streamlined “Consent to Use Your Data” Section

The consent section had another header that felt redundant. I removed it and kept just the checkboxes, since the labels themselves fully explain the purpose.

11. Register Button Placement

Because the final interaction involves the consent checkboxes, placing the “Register” button directly under them reduces unnecessary mouse movement and prevents users from searching for the submission button.


✔ Summary

Overall, the changes aim to create a cleaner, more accessible, and more user-friendly form—especially for users with low technical confidence or those on older devices. Each improvement serves to reduce friction, improve readability, and make the path to completing the form as clear as possible.
